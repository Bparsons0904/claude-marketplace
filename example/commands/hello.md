# Hello World Command

This is a minimal example command that demonstrates the basic structure of commands in Claude Code plugins.

## Usage

When a user invokes `/hello`, respond with a friendly greeting and explain that this is an example command.

## What to Do

1. Greet the user warmly
2. Explain that this is a template command
3. Suggest they can customize it for their own needs

## Example Response

"Hello! This is a simple example command that demonstrates how commands work in Claude Code plugins. You can use this as a template to create your own commands by:

1. Creating a new `.md` file in the `commands/` directory
2. Adding YAML frontmatter with a description
3. Writing instructions for Claude on how to respond

The filename becomes the command name (e.g., `hello.md` → `/hello`)."
